### Debate data:
When the atom numbers are too different, the result of procare seems to be not so convincing.

50 percent similarity? Segmentation?

### Conclusion
ProCare would be more strict, and will perform better when atom numbers are large. When the two pockets are mostly similar, ProCare can better detect the similarity, and outputs a higher score than PPSalign.
